## üìÑ Abstract

The digital transformation of music has created complex multi-platform ecosystems where success patterns remain poorly understood.  
This study develops a framework for predicting Billboard Hot 100 chart success through cross-platform performance analysis and temporal relationship modeling.  
Using weekly chart data from six platforms across 2024, the research employs Dynamic Time Warping clustering, Granger causality analysis, and Long Short-Term Memory neural networks not merely to quantify the visible transfer of success between platforms, but to uncover hidden temporal patterns and sequential relationships in cross-platform performance, independent of Billboard's own weighting rules.  
This study aims to go beyond the official chart methodology to identify latent connections and influences that may shape Hot 100 trajectories in ways not immediately apparent from published chart outcomes.  
The analysis identifies six distinct trajectory patterns in chart performance with high classification accuracy.  
Granger causality testing reveals temporal hierarchies where certain platforms serve as leading indicators with specific lag periods, while radio shows diminished predictive power.  
The integrated multi-platform approach demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models, though historical chart performance dominates prediction over cross-platform relationships.  
The findings provide practical guidance for industry stakeholders while advancing understanding of digital content diffusion in multi-platform environments.
